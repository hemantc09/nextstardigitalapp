Notes:  As per the instructions I have finished the assessment with following tasks  

1. GET Request parsing and Display Data
2. App logic based on requirement [Please see my algorithm below]
3. Supports all browser and Viewport :  Reference : https://www.responsinator.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpowerful-gorge-16063.herokuapp.com%2F
4. Matching Actual design as much possible and kept it responsive 

Bonus

1. Added animation to the page boxes on hover slight zoomed effect 
2. Modal on click : I was able to get the modal but unable to complete the dynamic data. I do believe I can make it work.
3. Add dynamic background image: Not completed. I will definitely try better.
